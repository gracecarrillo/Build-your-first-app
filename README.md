## Intro 

The Android universe is mainly build using Java and Kotlin, but in recent times, Flutter by Google has become very popular. With Flutter, you can design beautiful apps with minimal effort. This workshop introduces you to Flutter widgets—prebuilt elements that make it easy to create elegant and interactive user interfaces for iOS and Android. We'll build a personal business card app using Container, Row, Column, and Icon widgets. Along the way, we'll see how to split your code into multiple classes for maximum extensibility, use widgets to manipulate assets like images, and incorporate custom fonts and color schemes into your design. Plus, you'll learn how to use the Card and ListTile widgets to organise data and maximise the readability and accessibility of your app.

## BEFORE THE WORKSHOP

1. First, you will need to install and setup Flutter. To install and setup for Mac and Windows, [you can follow this tutorial.](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). If you are in China, first read this information on[ how to use Flutter in China](https://flutter.dev/community/china).

2. To open the folder with the tutorial, you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are many popular IDE environments for development. For this course, I will be using Android Studio. Follow this link to [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). If you are using a Mac, there are a few extra steps you will need to take. Follow [this instructions to set up Android Studio development in your Mac](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup). 

3. Download this repo as a zip file and unzip it.

5. We are ready to code!

## AFTER THE WORKSHOP

6. E-portfolio Evidence: Just focus on finishing the step-by-step and running your app in your local setup. Then, write a short 500-1000 word reflection on the course, what you learned, if you managed to run your app, how was it, if you didn’t, why? And this, accompanied by screenshots of your local setup and the app.
