    "Kivy has its own language dedicated to describing the user interface and various interactions. It is useful as the UI file can be separated from the logic file making the code more readable and manageable. We should separate these logics as in the `.kv` file, we don’t have to make any import statements. We need not worry about where the specific element is located in the Kivymd directory. Also we don’t need to explicitly bind a widget to its root widget. KV files follow a hierarchical structure where you can define one root widget and whenever you define components below this, they are by default added to the root widget.\n",

We get the data to be displayed from the backend layer, using python code in the form of a dictionary, where the key is the icon name and the value is the text to be displayed. The `app.data` searches in the app (the root widget) for the data variable and the `Main` class of our app holds that variable. It means we should define these variables in the class it belongs to. You will get a better idea when we build an example with multiple screens.\n",
