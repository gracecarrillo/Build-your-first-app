What it means is that the Kivy sets up all the essential things to run our app and we need to inherit this app class, change it, and build our application. The name of this class should start with capitals and it also serves as the name of the app which can be changed later on so you can name it anything you want.\n",

    "- `def` build function is the app entry point. All the things defined here will be built first and the first screen or the main screen is passed here. It returns the `Label`, and it has a property of text which has the value `Hello World`. Read more about labels [here](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.label.html).\n",
